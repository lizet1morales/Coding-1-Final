# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for F2020 Coding 1
I built my website about my artwork because it is a big part of my life. I have had a passion for art since I was in first grade. I didnâ€™t start caring about my artwork until I was in 7th grade. I plan to go to college and study more about art and create more pieces. One of my biggest supporters is my dad. Art is not just a hobby for me, it is a distraction from the outside world. I might not spend every hour or every day creating something but when I do, I put all my effort into the piece.
